# authing-lambda-auth

This project contains source code for a lambda authorizer for AWS API Gateway, using [Authing.cn](https://authing.cn/) as a replacement for AWS Cognito which is not availabel in AWS China region.

The project is built using AWS [SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) for easier local debugging and deployment for Lambda function.

To build and deploy your application for the first time, run the following in your shell:

```bash
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

## Use the SAM CLI to build and test locally

Build your application with the `sam build` command.

```bash
authing-lambda-auth$ sam build
```

The SAM CLI installs dependencies defined in `src/package.json`, creates a deployment package, and saves it in the `.aws-sam/build` folder.

Test a single function by invoking it directly with a test event. An event is a JSON document that represents the input that the function receives from the event source. Test events are included in the `events` folder in this project.

Run functions locally and invoke them with the `sam local invoke` command.

```bash
authing-lambda-auth$ sam local invoke --event events/event.json
```


## Cleanup

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name authing-lambda-auth
```

## Resources

See the [AWS SAM developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html) for an introduction to SAM specification, the SAM CLI, and serverless application concepts.

Next, you can use AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy ready to use Apps that go beyond hello world samples and learn how authors developed their applications: [AWS Serverless Application Repository main page](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/)
